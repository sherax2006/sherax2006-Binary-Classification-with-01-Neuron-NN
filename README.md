# Single-Neuron Neural Network for Binary Classification

This project implements a **single-neuron neural network** for **binary classification** using the **sigmoid activation function**. The model is trained using **gradient descent**, and training and validation loss curves are plotted to analyze whether the model is underfitting, overfitting, or showing well-behaved training.

The main objective of this project is to implement and understand the concepts of **forward propagation** and **backward propagation** in neural networks to learn optimal weights.

## Features
- Forward propagation using sigmoid activation  
- Backward propagation with binary cross-entropy loss  
- Weight and bias updates using gradient descent  
- Training and validation loss curves  
- Accuracy evaluation on test data  

## Output
- Training loss per epoch  
- Validation loss per epoch  
- Test accuracy  
- Training vs Validation loss plot
