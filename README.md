# sherax2006-Binary-Classification-with-01-Neuron-NN
Description: This project implements a single-neuron neural network for binary classification using the sigmoid activation function. The model is trained using gradient descent, and the training and validation loss curves are plotted to analyze underfitting, overfitting, or well-behaved training.
